Massa: The Decentralized and Scaled Blockchain
==============================================

Massa is a truly decentralized blockchain controlled by thousands of
people. With the breakthrough multithreaded technology, we're set for
mass adoption.

Introduction
------------

`Massa <https://massa.net>`_ is a new blockchain reaching a high
transaction throughput in a decentralized network. Our research is
published in this `technical paper <https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.09029>`_.
It shows that throughput of 10'000 transactions per second is reached
even in a fully decentralized network with thousands of nodes.

An easy-to-read blog post introduction with videos is written
`here <https://massa.net/blog/post/0/>`_.

We are now releasing the **Massa testnet** in this Github repository,
with its explorer available at https://test.massa.net.

Testnet
-------

As decentralization is our core value, we would like to help you start
and run a Massa node. Running a node during the testnet phase also helps
us find bugs and improve usability, so it will be rewarded with real
Massa on mainnet launch.

The mechanics of those rewards are described in the `Testnet rules <https://github.com/massalabs/massa/wiki/testnet_rules>`_.

Testnet Discussions
-------------------

Please come to our `Discord <https://discord.com/invite/massa>`_ for
testnet discussions, in the testnet channel.

For project announcements, we mainly use
`Telegram <https://t.me/massanetwork>`_, and we also have a `Twitter <https://twitter.com/MassaLabs>`_ account.
